# Brazil Labour Market Analysis (2020-2024) 🇧🇷

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Brazilian labour market evolution during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Using official data from the **International Labour Organization (ILO)**, I processed and consolidated five key socio-economic indicators into a single analytical dashboard.

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal was to clean, transform, and merge multiple raw datasets to visualize how different facets of the labour market (Unemployment, Informality, Youth status) interacted during the last five years.

### Key Indicators Analyzed:
* **Unemployment Rate:** Percentage of the labour force without work but seeking employment.
* **Informal Employment Rate:** Percentage of employed persons in informal jobs (lacking legal protections).
* **Youth NEET Rate:** Percentage of young people "Not in Employment, Education or Training".
* **Labour Force Participation Rate:** Percentage of the population that is either working or looking for work.
* **Employment-to-Population Ratio:** Percentage of the total working-age population that is employed.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python (Pandas):** For data cleaning, filtering (Brazil, 15+, Total Gender), and merging multiple CSV files.
* **Matplotlib:** For generating time-series visualizations.
* **Power BI:** (Planned) For interactive dashboarding using the cleaned dataset.

## 📈 Key Insights

* **Recovery:** The Unemployment Rate saw a significant drop from **13.7% (2020)** to **6.8% (2024)**.
* **The Informality Challenge:** Despite the economic recovery, the **Informal Employment Rate** remained stagnant around **36-38%**, indicating a structural challenge in the Brazilian economy.
* **Youth Inclusion:** The NEET Rate improved significantly, decreasing from **25.9%** to **19.3%**, showing better integration of youth into the education or labour market post-pandemic.

## 📂 Data Source
